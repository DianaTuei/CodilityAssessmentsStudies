1. Stacks are a linear data structure type which follow a particular order in which 
the operations are performed 
2. The order maybe 1. LIFO (Last in First Out) : element added last is accessed first
 or 2. FILO (First in Last Out) : elemented added first is accessed last 
3. Arrays are used to implement stacks 
4. The basic skeleton of a stack will look like : 
An object stack is created using the new operator and various methods are accessed thro'
the object 

    class Stack {
        constructor(){
            this.items = [];
        }
        //
    }
5. Common functions implemented are : push(item) : to add to stack 
                                      pop() :  returns top most element of stack and removes it 
                                      peek() : returns top most elements in the stack and does not delete it
6. Helper methods include : 
   isEmpty(); = returns true if a stack is isEmpty
   printStack(); = returns a string in which all elements of the stack are concatenated
