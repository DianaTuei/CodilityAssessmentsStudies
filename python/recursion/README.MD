## What is recursion ? 
- an algo writing process that involves divide and conquer or decrease and conquer 
- recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself


To prevent infinite loops in recursion 
1. The function must have 1 or more bse cases 
2. The recursive call must solve the same problem on some other input. 

Used typically like iterations to repeat tasks.
