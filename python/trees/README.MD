### Defination 
 a hierachical data structure that organizes inform of multiple sub-parts called nodes from a root level. 
 the left side is normally smaller than the right side 
### Implementation
to implement a tree data structure it involves using different approaches : same way you can paint a tree
, you can draw or even sculpture it

'''
1. Linked List representation : each node contains a child nodes : represents branches 
2. Array representation : using indices and arrays to organize and represent nodes in a tree like manner'
3. Recursive representation : using recursive structures , where each node contain references to its children.
