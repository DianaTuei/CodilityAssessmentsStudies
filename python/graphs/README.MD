### Defination 
A versatile data structure that models relationships between entities. 
Consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect a pairs of nodes. 
Graphs are normally used to solve problems where objects are interconnected in some way.

### Practical usages 
1. Social Networks : people are nodes and friendships are represented as edges between the nodes 
Each person is a node, and a friendship forms an edge between two nodes. This representation allows for analyzing social connections and interactions.

2. Recommendation systems : Recommending products or content based on connections between users and their preferences in a graph-like structure.

### Implementation 
Implementing involves defining the structure and operations that can be performed on the graph 
Different representations allow for efficient operations based on problem requirements 


'''
1. Adjacency List Representation: This uses a list or dictionary to store neighbors of each node. Each node is associated with a list of its neighboring nodes.
2. Adjacency Matrix Representation: This uses a 2D matrix to represent connections between nodes. Each cell in the matrix indicates whether there's an edge between the corresponding nodes.
