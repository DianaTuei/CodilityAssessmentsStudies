Easy : 

​print a triangle made of asterisks (‘*’) separated by spaces. The triangle should consist of n rows, where n is a given positive integer, and consecutive rows should 
contain 1, 2, . . . , n asterisks. For example, for n = 4 the triangle should appear as follows:

*
**
***
****

# pseudocode bit of this : 
<!-- What's are the knows -->
1. n is a positive integer (absolute)
2. printing starts at 1 
3. printing ends at 4
4. value increase by 1 on each iteration 
5. space between asterisks (format for the output)
6. n represents the rows 


The while loop can have a condition True or False : This is a common pattern for creating a indefinate loop that continues until a certain condition is met
