1. Write a GetNth() function that takes a linked list and an integer
index and returns the data value stored in the node at that index position. 

2. Given a Linked List and a number N,
 write a function that returns the value at the Nth node from the end of the Linked List.

3. Given a singly linked list, 
find the middle of the linked list. 
For example, if the given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the output should be 3. 
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, 
we need to print the second middle element. For example, 
if the given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the output should be 4. 


4. Given a linked list and a key ‘X‘ in, 
the task is to check if X is present in the linked list or not.
