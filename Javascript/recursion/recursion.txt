Recursion is a programming concept where a function call itself directly or indirectly in order to solve 
a problem.

Processes for an efficient recursion 
1. Base case defination : what brings an end to recursion
2. Divide and conquer : breakdown the problem into smaller, simpler
instances of the same problem. Each recursive call should bring the 
problem closer to the base case. 
3. Avoid redudant work : fibonnacci sequence -> using recursion :
Two main algo. is use : memoization , dynamic programming (algo) :
OPTIMIZATION IN RECURSION.
