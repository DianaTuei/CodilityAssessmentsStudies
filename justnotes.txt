1. Good Programming ? 
    - More code not necessarily a good thing 
    - Measure good programmers by amount of functionality and mechanisms to achieve decomposition and abstraction 

    Functions are the basis of good programming / computational thinking , offers modularity : decomposition and
    abstraction.(the idea of building and just using provided correct type of inputs / not having to worry if different input will work  )

    Example of decomposition
     - Vancouver Olympics Opening ceremony : they projected a large image at the center of the rink
     - How it worked : projecting the large image was decomposed into separate tasks for separate projectors 
     - each projector takes an input , and produces a separate output , they work in synchrony to produce the larger image 

     Thats decomposition 
      = take different devices 
      = have them synchronize , 
      = produce an end goal.

    In code : 
      = Break up a problem into different self contained pieces 
      = build the solutions to the small problems 
      = synchronize them in a sequence of steps 
      = produce an end result
